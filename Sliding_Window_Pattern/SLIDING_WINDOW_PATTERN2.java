/*
ðŸŒŸ Sliding Window "At Most to Equal" trick
NOTE: this is an extension to my "C++ Maximum Sliding Window Cheatsheet Template!". Please make sure you are familiar with this template first.

- For a find maximum sliding window problem that is looking for windows with exactly k something in it, we can convert it to a problem that is looking for at most k something in it.
- It's because "number of windows with exactly k something in it" = "number of windows with at most k something in it" - "number of windows with at most k - 1 something in it".

- Take 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum (Medium) for example, if we want to use the "find maximum sliding window template" without this trick, we would need to use 3 pointers -- i as the left edge of the window with goal number of 1s in it, j as the left edge of the window with goal - 1 number of 1s in it, and k as the right edge.

//This code is repetitive -- we need to do similar jobs for i and j, and keep states for both windows.
// By extracting an atMost function, we make the code cleaner and less error-prone.
