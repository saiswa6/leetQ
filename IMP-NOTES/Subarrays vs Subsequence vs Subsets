What are Subsequences?

A subarray is a contiguous part of array and maintains relative ordering of elements. For an array/string of size n, there are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty subarrays/substrings.

A subsequence maintain relative ordering of elements but may or may not be a contiguous part of an array. For a sequence of size n, we can have 2^n-1 non-empty sub-sequences in total.

A subset MAY NOT maintain relative ordering of elements and can or cannot be a contiguous part of an array. For a set of size n, we can have (2^n) distinct sub-sets in total.
- when we find subset of a set we dont take a subset which is a permutation
  example {1,2,3}:
  {2,1} and {1,2} are the same thing that is {2,1} is permutation of {1,2}--> so we count it only once.
- Subset: Same as subsequence except it has empty set i.e. taht's why 2^n.

Consider an array:
array = [1,2,3,4]
Subarray : [1,2],[1,2,3] - is continous and maintains relative order of elements
Subsequence: [1,2,4] - is not continous but maintains relative order of elements
Subset: [1,3,2] - is not continous and does not maintain relative order of elements

Some interesting observations :
Every Subarray is a Subsequence.
Every Subsequence is a Subset.
--> Solution of finding subsequence is same as finding subset for array. sae method works.
