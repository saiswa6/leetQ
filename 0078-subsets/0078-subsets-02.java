Algorithm
We define a backtrack function named backtrack(first, curr) which takes the index of first element to add and a current combination, nums as arguments.

1. Current combination is done, we add the combination to the final output.
2. We iterate over the indexes i from first to the length of the entire sequence n.
   - Add integer nums[i] into the current combination curr.
   - Proceed to add more integers into the combination : backtrack(i + 1, curr).
   - Backtrack by removing nums[i] from curr.

Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity: O(NÃ—2^N) to generate all subsets and then copy them into output list. for every recursive call in the recursion tree, we copy an array list which takes O(N) time, making overall T.C to be O(N x 2^N).
Space complexity: O(N). We are using O(N) space to maintain curr, and are modifying curr in-place with backtracking. Note that for space complexity analysis, we do not count space that is only used for the purpose of returning output, so the output array is ignored.


class Solution {
    List<List<Integer>> output = new ArrayList<>();
    int n;

    public void backtrack(int start, ArrayList<Integer> curr, int [] nums)
    {
        output.add(new ArrayList<>(curr));

        for(int i = start; i < n; i++)
        {
           // 1. Add current choice to our current running list
            curr.add(nums[i]);
           // 2. Jump into the next level of decision tree
           // The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets
           // So here is "i+1", which means the element behind our current choice
            backtrack(i + 1, curr, nums);
           // 3. Undo current choice
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);   // Don't do by curr.remove(nums[i]) because remove method accepts indices only.
        }
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        n = nums.length;
        backtrack(0, new ArrayList<Integer>(), nums);
        return output;
    }
}



When it comes to subset, combination, permutation, tree path sum, think of DFS+backtracking.
Time Complexity: O( n * 2^n )
Space Complexity: O( n * 2^n )
   
Review of DFS + backtracking template


def backtrack( parameter ):
	# Base case handle, aka stop condition
	if stop condition:
		# save valid result if needed
		return
		
	# General cases handle:
	for each possible next move/next selection:
		
		make a next move/ select a element	
		backtrack( updated parameter )		
		roll back / undo selection
		
	return
