EXPLANATION
/*
First, iterate the string 's' and store the indexes of 'c' present in 's' into an array or vector ( here vector<int>ioc ) .
Make a left variable for storing the index of left nearest 'c' in ioc and a right variable for storing the index of right nearest 'c' in ioc. Initially, left=0 and right=0, that is keeping the first index of ioc.
Then, iterate string 's' again and at each iteration check if current index crosses ioc[right] ( that is index of 'c' present in ioc pointed by right ) then we need to make left = right and right=right+1.
Also, at each iteration find the minimum value between the following two and store it in ans[i].
  absolute value of (right nearest 'c' - current index) represented by abs(ioc[right]-i)
  absolute value of (left nearest 'c' - current index) represented by abs(ioc[left]-i)
Return ans.

TIME COMPLEXITY
O(n+n)=O(n) [ For iterating the string two times ]

SPACE COMPLEXITY
O(n) [ In worst case, all characters of 's' is 'c', at that time ( number of 'c' in 's' = size of 's' ) ]
