Can we assume the input is valid?
Yes. Here on Leetcode, you can make that assumption because you haven't been told what to do if it isn't.
In a real interview, this is a question you should ask the interviewer. Don't ever assume without asking in a real interview that the input has to be valid.

Is there only one valid representation for each number?
- Given that the representation for 3 is III, it could seem natural that the representation for 15 is VVV, because that would be 5 + 5 + 5. However, it's actually XV, which is 10 + 5. How are you even supposed to know which is correct?

- The trick is to use the "biggest" symbols you can. Because X is bigger than V, we should use an X first and then make up the remainder with a single V, giving XV.

What is CXVII as an integer?
Recall that C = 100, X = 10, V = 5, and I = 1. Because the symbols are ordered from most significant to least, we can simply add the symbols, i.e. C + X + V + I + I = 100 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 117.

What is CMXCIV as an integer?
The symbols barely look sorted at all here from left to right we have 100, 1000, 10, 100, 1, 5. Do not panic though, we just need to look for each occurrence of a smaller symbol preceding a bigger symbol. The first, third, and fifth symbols are all smaller than their next symbol. Therefore they are all going to be subtracted from their next.

The first two symbols are CM. This is M - C = 1000 - 100 = 900
The second two symbols are XC. This is C - X = 100 - 10 = 90.
The final two symbols are IV. This is V - I = 5 - 1 = 4.
Like we did above, we add these together. (M - C) + (C - X) + (V - I) = 900 + 90 + 4 = 994.

Approach 1: Left-to-Right Pass
Intuition
Let's hard-code a mapping with the value of each symbol so that we can easily look them up. - Symbol mapping

Now, recall that each symbol adds its own value, except for when a smaller valued symbol is before a larger valued symbol. In those cases, instead of adding both symbols to the total, we need to subtract the large from the small, adding that instead.

Therefore, the simplest algorithm is to use a pointer to scan through the string, at each step deciding whether to add the current symbol and go forward 1 place, or add the difference of the next 2 symbols and go forward 2 places. Here is this algorithm in pseudocode.

pseudocode :
total = 0
i = 0
while i < s.length:
    if at least 2 symbols remaining AND value of s[i] < value of s[i + 1]:
        total = total + (value of s[i + 1]) - (value of s[i])  
        i = i + 2
    else:
        total = total + (value of s[i])
        i = i + 1
return total

Complexity Analysis :
Let n be the length of the input string (the total number of symbols in it)
Time complexity : O(1)
As there is a finite set of roman numerals, the maximum number possible number can be 3999, which in roman numerals is MMMCMXCIX. As such the time complexity is O(1).
If roman numerals had an arbitrary number of symbols, then the time complexity would be proportional to the length of the input, i.e. O(n). This is assuming that looking up the value of each symbol is O(1)

Space complexity : O(1)
Because only a constant number of single-value variables are used, the space complexity is O(1).
