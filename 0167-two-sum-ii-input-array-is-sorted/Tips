/*
In an interview, whenever you're given a question where the input array is sorted, here are some super useful things to consider:
1. Binary Search
2. Two (or three) pointers
3. A sliding window
4. Traversing from the right

Make sure to write down a couple examples and try experimenting with these approaches. Even understanding that these approaches may aid in finding an answer with a sorted array, you're showing your interviewer that you have a good understanding of the array datastructure. Be mindful of negative values and duplicates as you're experimenting!
