- We are given string sss in a particular form k[string] and we have to decode it as string repeated k times . For example,2[b] is decoded as bb.
- The problem seems straightforward at first glance. But the trick here is that there can be nested encoded strings like k[string k[string]]. 
- For example, string s =3[a2[c]]. In such cases, we must decode the innermost string and continue in an outward direction until the entire string is decoded.

Approach 1: Using Stack
Intuition
- We have to decode the result in a particular pattern. We know that the input is always valid. The pattern begins with a number k, followed by opening braces [, followed by string. Post that, 
  there could be one of the following cases :
- There is another nested pattern k[string k[string]]
- There is a closing bracket k[string]
- Since we have to start decoding the innermost pattern first, continue iterating over the string s, pushing each character to the stack until it is not a closing bracket ]. 
  Once we encounter the closing bracket ], we must start decoding the pattern.

As we know that stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) Principle, the top of the stack would have the data we must decode.

/*
Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(maxKcountKâ‹…n), where maxK is the maximum value of k, countK is the count of nested kkk values and nnn is the maximum length of encoded string.
Example, for s = 20[a10[bc]], maxK is 20, countK is 2 as there are 2 nested k values (20 and 10) . Also, there are 2 encoded strings a and bc with maximum length of encoded string ,n as 2
