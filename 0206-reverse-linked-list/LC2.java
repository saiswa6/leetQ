Approach 2: Recursive
Intuition
- The recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do we reverse the front part? 
  Let's assume the list is: n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 → … → nm → Ø

-  Assume from node nk+1 to nm had been reversed and we are at node nk.
-  n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 ← … ← nm
- We want nk+1’s next node to point to nk.
  So,
  nk.next.next = nk;

Be very careful that n1's next must point to Ø. If you forget about this, your linked list will have a cycle in it. This bug could be caught if you test your code with a linked list of size 2.

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }
        ListNode p = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return p;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis
Time complexity : O(n)
Assume that n is the list's length, the time complexity is O(n)

Space complexity : O(n)
The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. The recursion could go up to n levels deep.

// Suggestion : pushing all values onto a stack and then building out the list as you pop from the stack? That would be O(n) time and O(n) space.
